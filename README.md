# Another2048

Another2048 is my own implementation of the [original 2048 game](http://2048game.com/) but with a slight twist. Said twist being that it's all built in the Unreal Engine 4. I've made it a personal goal of mine to relearn C++ and master UE4 over the summer of 2019. I've gone through quite a few tutorials on the engine and now I wish to create something on my own that feels fully fleshed out, polished, and like a real game that one would find on platforms such as Steam or GOG. I thought about it carefully and decided that my first solo project with UE4 would be creating my own version of 2048.

### Progress
Currently, Another2048 is a work in progress. In it's current state, the game works as it should and it looks pretty decent to boot. It still needs some polish but it's coming along well. A playable version will be up soon for download along with a web version if possible.

### Notes about cloning/forking
Many of the assets I am using I haven't added to the repo. As such, you won't be able to compile and get the game up and running on your own (although I would like to change that soon). I don't want to upload several gigs worth of Unreal Marketplace stuff but I will list what I'm using below:

* [Brushify](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/brushify-shaders-pack) - Using the snow shader for painting the terrain.
* [Fantasy Village](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/fantasy-and-medieval-artchitecture-kit) - Used for the bulk of the meshes in the scene. 
* [Fantasy Orchestra](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/fantasy-orchestral-music) - Background music
* [Particle Effects](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/Showcases/Effects/index.html?utm_source=launcher&utm_medium=ue&utm_campaign=uelearn) - Wind and snow. This one isn't from the Unreal Marketplace though. To download it, go under the *Unreal Engine -> Learn* tab on the Epic Games client.
